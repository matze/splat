**Street photography** is photography conducted for art or inquiry that features
unmediated chance encounters and random incidents within public places. It
usually has the aim of capturing images at a decisive or poignant moment by
careful framing and timing. Street photography overlaps widely with candid
photography, although the latter can also be used in other settings, such as
portrait photography and event photography.

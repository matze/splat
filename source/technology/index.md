**Technology** is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical
goals, especially in a reproducible way. The word technology can also mean
the products resulting from such efforts, including both tangible tools
such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology
plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.

Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The
earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistory, followed by
the control of fireâ€”which in turn contributed to the growth of the human brain
and the development of language during the Ice Age, according to the cooking
hypothesis. The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel
and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions,
including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have lowered barriers
to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.
